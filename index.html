                <p>
                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews

                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what
                    I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                    I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session,
                    I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                    summaries of what I learned using my own words.

                                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
                                    then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                                </br>
                                <br>
                                    <strong>
                                        How I got started
                                    </strong>
                                </br>
                                <br>
                                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would 
                                    take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd 
                                    use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                                </br>
                                <br>
                                That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summarie
                                s was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
