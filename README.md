# My Learning Journal

This is a responsive learning journal and blog website, built to showcase my progress as a web development student.

**Live Demo:** [mylearningjournal.netlify.app](minhlearningjournal.netlify.app)

### Project Features

  * **Responsive Layout:** The site adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
  * **Theme Toggle:** A toggle button allows users to switch between a dark and a light theme.
  * **Dynamic Navigation:** Clicking different links (Home, About Me) and the main hero section reveals and hides content without reloading the page.
  * **"View More" Functionality:** A button dynamically shows and hides additional blog posts with a smooth sliding animation.

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The HTML file provides a clear, semantic structure for the entire website. The main content is organized into logical sections:

  * **`<header>`:** Contains the site logo and the main navigation links. It includes separate elements for desktop and mobile navigation to handle responsiveness.
  * **`<main>`:** Houses all the primary content sections of the page, including the hero section, full blog post view, about me page, and the blog post grid.
  * **`<footer>`:** Displays the site's title and copyright information, which is dynamically generated by JavaScript.
  * **Hidden Sections:** Pages like the full blog post (`.full-blog-post`) and about me (`.about-section`) are initially hidden with the `.hidden` CSS class and are shown/hidden by JavaScript based on user actions.

-----

### CSS Styling (`style.css`)

The styling is designed with a **mobile-first approach** in mind. A dark theme is the default, and a lighter theme is provided for user customization.

  * **Global Styles:** Universal styles for fonts, colors, and box-sizing are set for consistency.
  * **Theme Toggling:** The `body.light-theme` selector is the core of the light theme functionality. JavaScript adds this class to the `<body>` element, and the CSS then overrides the default dark theme colors.
  * **Mobile and Desktop Navigation:** Different styling rules are applied to the navigation based on screen size, with the mobile menu initially hidden and the desktop menu appearing on larger screens via media queries.
  * **Responsive Design:** A `@media (min-width: 768px)` query refactors the layout for larger screens, using CSS Grid to organize the content into distinct areas (`header`, `hero`, `blog-posts`, `footer`).
  * **Animations:** The code includes keyframes (`@keyframes slideDown`, `@keyframes fadeIn`) to create smooth transitions when elements appear or disappear.

-----

### JavaScript Functionality (`index.js`)

The JavaScript code handles all the interactive elements of the site, making it feel like a single-page application.

  * **Theme Toggle:** Event listeners on the theme toggle buttons manage the `light-theme` class on the `<body>` element and store the user's preference in `localStorage`.
  * **Mobile Menu:** The mobile navigation button uses an event listener to toggle the `active` class on the mobile menu, sliding it into and out of view.
  * **Page Navigation:** Clicks on the main navigation links and the hero section trigger functions that add and remove the `.hidden` class on the different content sections, allowing for seamless transitions between the main, full post, and about pages.
  * **"View More" Button:** This button's click handler toggles a `postsVisible` boolean. When clicked, it iterates through the additional `.extra-post` elements, adding a sliding animation before removing the `.hidden` class to reveal them. A second click reverses this process, hiding the posts again.
